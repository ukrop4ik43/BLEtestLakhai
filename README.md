Hi! I want to share my new pet project with you.
This pet project show my skills on working with BLE devices using Android apps.
Technology stack on this project is: Android SDK, Koin, Jetpack compose.
App's main functionality is to detect BLE device based on UUID, and connect to it.

After that user can see the distance between phone, and BLE device!
